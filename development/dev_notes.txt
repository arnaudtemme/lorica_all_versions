- visualization : Marijn finishes, we add case study + data (runfile) --> towards publication

KEY TASKS AND THEIR ORDER:
2. FINISHED Ale - separate branch - improve temporally changing root cohesion, OM input, tillage, bioturbation rate, as a function of landuse
2. FINISHED A - landslide inside
3a. FINISHED A - splitting into different files 
3b. FINISHED A - setting NA value as a variable
1. MvdM - transport functions + apply everywhere, 
1b. MvdM -remove restart inside the code after crashing
4a. MvdM : 
	-- layer thickness: 1. top layer thickness, 2. traingular or a fixed factor, 3. max number of layers, 4. calculate layers. 
	-- default number soil layers = 20
	-- split only the top layer when it gets too thick, and then immediately and always merge the bottom two layers if we need it. Remove/deactivate more complex options 
4b. Ale - all interface changes
5a. ArT + MvdM : model testing, checking functions, good error messaging (also xml reading writing), factor 100. 
5b. Check functions, w/ literature, add DOI: Arnaud: geom, sinks, Marijn: soil mostly
6. ArT - check Lorica for loose, unitless, parameters and warnings 
7 from separate branch Alessia; - proglacial code merge 


INTERFACE RELATED:
For Alessia:
-- FINISHED remove solifluction tab
-- FINISHED tree fall to expe
-- FINISHED blocks to experimental
-- FINISHED rock weathering to soil as spoil production
-- FINISHED pohys weath particle size to soil specifier
-- FINISHED chem weath surface area to soil specifier
-- FINISHED carbon cyclke -> organic matter
-- FINISHED TWI decay constant remove
-- FINISHED remove decalcification
-- EXISTS geochron tracers stays
-- FINISHED particle ages --> luminescence
-- FINISHED hydrological to experimental (and remove default values)
-- FINISHED allow to read in OM in soil specifier
-- FINISHED iterate DEMs to experiemental; 
-- FINISHED remove sinks and flats before, after ruinning cleaner
-- FINISHED all versions go to experiemental tab, also calib/sensit, also purely calculate terrain derivatives
-- EXISTS add explanation of satrt at year
-- FINISHED remove parallel stuff
-- FINISHED output code : remove
-- FINISHED structure timeseries output
-- FINISHED when ready --> at final timestep, not a choice
-- FINISHED profile outputs: remove 
-- FINISHED remove diagnostic output
-- FINISHED/MORE POSSIBLE add extra output maps to experimental tab (lakes)
-- FINISHED make entire model smaller
-- FINISHED runfile --> settings
-- FINISHED deactivate the start button once clicked
-- FINISHED fix the soil specifier open after clicking X
-- check that the mnodel really does not run when wrong decimal separator
-- update the xml reading and writing with removed and added parameters (esp. landuse and soil specifier variables)
-- start button re-activate when better inputs needed
=- clean up input section
-- fixing button thingy landuse popup

For Arnaud:
-- steps already done

For Marijn:
-- Two OM models next to each other
-- bioturbation upheaval to treefall
-- split mounding and mxing in bioturbation
-- check clay dynbamics versus chemical weathering
-- change Jagercikova cm units
--check tillage 0,1,2 or nodata 


WISHLIST
- possibility to set fixed BD value in interfae instead of PTF
