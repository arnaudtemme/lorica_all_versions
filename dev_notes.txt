Changes Jan 2026

-Corrected a mistake in bedrock weathering -  it could only work if proglacial mode was active
-Added coarse map as input among experimental 
-In deposition, only sand and clay could be deposited. silt could only be eroded. Now fixed by creating the new silt_deposited and silt_in_transport variables
-When writing and reading the xml file, the value of physical weathering was being assigned to the chemical weathering instead. Now fixed. 
-Added or changed warning messages to suggest that whenever a file was not written, it might still be open on the user´s computer
-Changed the writeallsoils function to also write soil layers of thickness=0 to the output soil file


Changes September 2025 

-Algorithm choices from drop list can now be saved to xml (e.g. bioturbation algorithms, OM algorithms, etc.)

-the error message "failed at timestep" used to show the value of the variable t. Now fixed to show t+1 which is the actual timestep of failure

-Soil depths very close to zero were causing NaN values in some circumstances, which lead to the following error message: "Exception thrown: 'System.OverflowException' in mscorlib.dll".
Added these lines to the activity fraction which now prevents it.
if (soildepth_m < 1e-6)  // If soil depth is too small, use a default safe value //AleG
{
   return 0.0;  // Return a reasonable default for small soil depths
}

-The logic of writeallsoils() was causing for the timestep column in 0_1_out_allsoils.csv to show t_out=0 instead of t_out=1. Now fixed by requiring the reference time variable as in insput if the fuction writeallsoils().

Proglacial mode:
-Added meltwater contribution for the proglacial mode with different rates based on literature that you can choose from the interface.
-I changed the logic for the proglacial mode (before the glacier cells were no data, but now they are instead just masked). The following processes have been adapted so that they can be used in the proglacial mode: Processes which can be simulated: Water erosion, Soil production, Physical weath., Chemical weath., Clay dynamics, Bioturbation, Organic Matter




Lorica update  - July 2025
All changes are marked with "//AleG" for now

Land use popup:
-Some of the values (e.g. K_fac) were not being properly read. Now fixed.
-Removal of P factor, which was not actually being used anymore.
-Added a box for the root cohesion. It gets read in the landslide module and in the erosion module it is linked to the bioprotection constant. Right now, bio protection constant = 0.1*root cohesion
-root_cohesion_kPa_new[row, col] is now a map rather than a single value
-The root cohesion is inputted as an absolute value (as specified by the description of the popup) rather than a relative multiplier
-Added all to the reading/writing to the xml

OM:
-yombox e oombox in soil specifier were not being read but they are now
-added yombox e oombox to initialise_soil
-added yombox e oombox in the reading/writing of the xml

Landslides module:
-The root cohesion can be read as an input from the land use popup
-The root cohesion is now a map. I updated the Cohesion_factor calculation to accommodate that.
-pulled minimum_slope_for_movement_tan to the interface
-Input cohesion and transmissivity removed from interface as they were actually being calculated by the model
-In calc_transmissivity() the formulas were corrected to feature silt/clay/OM percentages rather than fractions 
-In Ks_wosten, OM and silt are forced to be at least 1% to avoid divisions by zero which occasionally made transmissivity infinite
-Removal of outdated variables (cel_dist, sed_bud_m, dh_slid)
-made slide status a default output of landsliding

Rock weathering/Soil production module
-Renamed the dropdown box to rockweath_method_box and created the int variable rockweath_method
-Added a line in the portion of the code in which the inputs get read to read the content of rockweath_method_box
-Saved to/read from xml
-It used to crash due to the dropdown box not being pro but after the changes it does not 

Other
-Rearranged the tabs so that Input|Run|Output are at the beginning
-advection_erodibility substituted with erodibility_value_m in transport_capacity_kg
-In multiple parts of the code, all cells of the dtm were being processed instead of excluding the no data ones. "dtm[row, col] == nodata_value" added where necessary
-Added a line to manually overwrite no data cells in out_double and out_integer. This overwrites the problem but it does not solve it.
-Added the selection from the dropdown menus for bt_depth_function (bioturbation) and som_cycle_algorithm (organic matter) to the reading/writing xml
-In the interface corrected the "specific area coefficient"´s unit of measurements to m-1
-Corrected one of the activity_fraction formula which was missing a portion (I forgot to mark this one and cannot find it anymore! Maybe it had already been fixed in the previous release)

To do:
In LU popup connect OM input, Tillage, etc.
Merge with Marijn´s last version! E.g. no more "writeinputsoil" and fixed OM decay which was integrated w/depth
Fix issue of no data values not being taken into account in output
Add unit of measurements to the interface in the pages for tillage  

Outdated/not used code:
para_tillage_constant is in the interface but is never used
neoform_rate_constant is in the interface but is never used
Frost_weathering_checkbox does not actually do anything - and it is not visible in the interface 
initialise_soil_standard() is defined but never used
sum_biological_weathering[row, col] = 0; created but not used 

Issues:
Organic Matter with "ICBM" algorithm produces some very odd results once a thick layer is split. The bottom layers become thousands of meters thick and the OOM is infinite in those layers
The uniform thickness button gives different results for output thickness compared to before the last update
-Tillage (no map, just changed to 1 in input page) takes ages/never ends
in void transfer_OSL_grains, P_fromto = ∞, P_tofrom=0. It crashes when it reaches this line: P_transfer = Convert.ToInt32(Math.Round(1000000000 * P_fromto)); 



Older dev notes:

- visualization : Marijn finishes, we add case study + data (runfile) --> towards publication

WISHLIST
- possibility to set fixed BD value in interface instead of PTF MvdM
- collective transfer function for transport into pools which is later redistributed (bt_mixing, tillage mixing / upheaval, treefall, water erosion?) MvdM
- put all case studies / calibration studies in popup window
- empty output folder before simulations, to avoid old and new files in one directory. Give warning or popup window if there are files present

ERRORS & DEVELOPMENT
- initial soil properties
	- YOM and OOM fractions are included in the total sum of mass fractions
	- Error when a cell is emptied before a new value is entered
	- YOM and OOM fractions are not considered in initialise_soil(). 
	- should be included in initial BD calculations as well
	- However, does it make sense to specify initial SOM? We don't want constant SOM throughout the soil profiles. Maybe specify topsoil SOM and use SOM parameters to create a depth curve
- difference initialize_once and initialize_once_testing, and which one should be used?
- FINISHED upheaval: build check for limiting mixing depth to available soil depth
- bulk_density_calc: when a layer is split, the total thickness of the two new layers is larger than of the original layer, due to differences in bulk density calculations. 
   - Approach to solve this: integrate over top and bottom elevation of layer
   - Calculate average of the integral and calculate back which depth corresponds to this value
   - use that value in BD calculations instead of the depth of the midpoint of the layer
   - check if this solves the problem
- one code for initialize_once(_testing)
- integrate initialise_every_till into initialise_every
- tillfields_constant_value never actually used in the code
- The root cohesion could be connected to the Water erosion somehow since it is the only value in the landuse popup that is not connected to Water erosion.
