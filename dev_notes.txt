- visualization : Marijn finishes, we add case study + data (runfile) --> towards publication

KEY TASKS AND THEIR ORDER:
2. FINISHED Ale - separate branch - improve temporally changing root cohesion, OM input, tillage, bioturbation rate, as a function of landuse
2. FINISHED A - landslide inside
3a. FINISHED A - splitting into different files 
3b. FINISHED A - setting NA value as a variable
1. FINISHED MvdM - transport functions + apply everywhere, 
1b. FINISHED MvdM -remove restart inside the code after crashing
4a. FINISHED MvdM : update layering
4b. Ale - all interface changes
5a. ArT + MvdM : model testing, checking functions, good error messaging (also xml reading writing), factor 100. 
5b. Check functions, w/ literature, add DOI: Arnaud: geom, sinks, Marijn: soil mostly
6. ArT - check Lorica for loose, unitless, parameters and warnings 
7 from separate branch Alessia; - proglacial code merge 


INTERFACE RELATED:
For Alessia:
-- FINISHED remove solifluction tab
-- FINISHED tree fall to expe
-- FINISHED blocks to experimental
-- FINISHED rock weathering to soil as spoil production
-- FINISHED pohys weath particle size to soil specifier
-- FINISHED chem weath surface area to soil specifier
-- FINISHED carbon cyclke -> organic matter
-- FINISHED TWI decay constant remove
-- FINISHED remove decalcification
-- EXISTS geochron tracers stays
-- FINISHED particle ages --> luminescence
-- FINISHED hydrological to experimental (and remove default values)
-- FINISHED allow to read in OM in soil specifier
-- FINISHED iterate DEMs to experiemental; 
-- FINISHED remove sinks and flats before, after ruinning cleaner
-- FINISHED all versions go to experiemental tab, also calib/sensit, also purely calculate terrain derivatives
-- EXISTS add explanation of start at year
-- FINISHED remove parallel stuff
-- FINISHED output code : remove
-- FINISHED structure timeseries output
-- FINISHED when ready --> at final timestep, not a choice
-- FINISHED profile outputs: remove 
-- FINISHED remove diagnostic output
-- FINISHED/MORE POSSIBLE add extra output maps to experimental tab (lakes)
-- FINISHED make entire model smaller
-- FINISHED runfile --> settings
-- FINISHED deactivate the start button once clicked
-- FINISHED fix the soil specifier open after clicking X
-- FINISHED fix the landuse_det open after clicking X
-- FINISHED write output at t = 0 before simulations
-- check that the model really does not run when wrong decimal separator
-- FINISHED updated the xml file saving and reading (land use pop up, increasing thickness ratio, proglacial mode)
-- FINISHED Renamed inputs in input page for consistency
-- FINISHED Fix various radio-buttons and buttons for f(x,y) and f(t)
-- FINISHED made tillage button editable, 0 as default
-- FINISHED Made the f(t) button inaccessible for Land use and tillage fields
-- FINISHED Made Physical weathering and water erosion the only processes active by default
-- FINISHED In the "Input" page, made the hovering to ask for information more obvious


Other changes Alessia:
-- FINISHED In old_SOM_kg[row, col, layer] corrected from "Math.Exp(-young_OM_decomp_char_decay_depth_m * depth)" to "Math.Exp(depth/young_OM_decomp_char_decay_depth_m)"
-- FINISHED In layer_bioturbation_kg, the last required variable was corrected from "layerthickness_m[row, col, layer]" to "depth + layerthickness_m[row, col, layer]"
-- FINISHED In soil_bioturbation_mixing(): dd_bt changed to dd_bt_m
-- FINISHED In soil_bioturbation_mixing(): due to unit change, "-dd_bt *" changed to "/-dd_bt_m" in three lines 
-- FINISHED Proglacial version added
-- FINISHED land use pop up can now be saved into a xml 


	-- Marijn: I have my computer set to dutch regional settings, but overwritten the decimal separator to point. This also produced an error. So we need to mention in the manual which exact regional setting works for the model
-- update the xml reading and writing with removed and added parameters (esp. landuse and soil specifier variables)
   -- figure out how we can keep updating this without giving issues in the future when other parameters are added
   -- new parameters from Marijn: in bioturbation, SOM cycling, layering
-- start button re-activate when better inputs needed



For Arnaud:
-- steps already done

For Marijn:
-- FINISHED Two OM models next to each other
-- NOT NEEDED bioturbation upheaval to treefall
-- FINISHED split mounding and mixing in bioturbation
-- check clay dynbamics versus chemical weathering
-- change Jagercikova cm units
--check tillage fields 0,1,2 or nodata 


WISHLIST
- possibility to set fixed BD value in interface instead of PTF MvdM
- collective transfer function for transport into pools which is later redistributed (bt_mixing, tillage mixing / upheaval, treefall, water erosion?) MvdM
- put all case studies / calibration studies in popup window
- empty output folder before simulations, to avoid old and new files in one directory. Give warning or popup window if there are files present

ERRORS & DEVELOPMENT
- initial soil properties
	- YOM and OOM fractions are included in the total sum of mass fractions
	- Error when a cell is emptied before a new value is entered
	- YOM and OOM fractions are not considered in initialise_soil(). 
	- should be included in initial BD calculations as well
	- However, does it make sense to specify initial SOM? We don't want constant SOM throughout the soil profiles. Maybe specify topsoil SOM and use SOM parameters to create a depth curve
- difference initialize_once and initialize_once_testing, and which one should be used?
- FINISHED upheaval: build check for limiting mixing depth to available soil depth
- bulk_density_calc: when a layer is split, the total thickness of the two new layers is larger than of the original layer, due to differences in bulk density calculations. 
   - Approach to solve this: integrate over top and bottom elevation of layer
   - Calculate average of the integral and calculate back which depth corresponds to this value
   - use that value in BD calculations instead of the depth of the midpoint of the layer
   - check if this solves the problem
- one code for initialize_once(_testing)
- integrate initialise_every_till into initialise_every
- tillfields_constant_value never actually used in the code
- The root cohesion could be connected to the Water erosion somehow since it is the only value in the landuse popup that is not connected to Water erosion.
